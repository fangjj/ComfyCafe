# Privacy Policy

Last updated 16 June 2016

*Your privacy is critically important to us. At ComfySoft LLC we have a few fundamental principles:*

- We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your sexual orientation or favorite anime for no apparent reason.)
- We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
- We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
- We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.
This privacy policy is adapted from [Automattic's Privacy Policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/), and as such, is available under a [Creative Commons Sharealike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

ComfySoft LLC ("ComfySoft") operates several websites including comfy.cafe, comfy.cafe, and comfy.cafe. It is ComfySoft LLC's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, ComfySoft LLC collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ComfySoft LLC's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ComfySoft LLC's visitors use its website. From time to time, ComfySoft LLC may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

ComfySoft LLC also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. ComfySoft LLC only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to ComfySoft LLC's websites choose to interact with ComfySoft LLC in ways that require ComfySoft LLC to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ComfySoft LLC gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at ComfyCafé to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with ComfySoft LLC are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, ComfySoft LLC collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with ComfySoft LLC. ComfySoft LLC does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

ComfySoft LLC may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, ComfySoft LLC may analyze the relationships between the types of images users like on the ComfyCafé site. ComfySoft LLC may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ComfySoft LLC does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

ComfySoft LLC discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ComfySoft LLC's behalf or to provide services available at ComfySoft LLC's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ComfySoft LLC's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ComfySoft LLC will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ComfySoft LLC discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when ComfySoft LLC believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ComfySoft LLC, third parties or the public at large.
